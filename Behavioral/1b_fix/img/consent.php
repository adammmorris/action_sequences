		The purpose of this research is to examine which factors influence social judgment and decision-making. You will be asked to make judgments about individuals and actions in social scenarios. We are simply interested in your judgment. The study will take approximately <?php echo $_GET['time'] ?> minutes to complete, and you will receive $<?php echo $_GET['money'] ?> on Amazon Mechanical Turk. There are no anticipated risks associated with participating in this study.  The effects of participating should be comparable to those you would ordinarily experience from viewing a computer monitor and using a mouse or keyboard for a similar amount of time. At the end of the study, we will provide an explanation of the questions that motivate this line of research and will describe the potential implications.
