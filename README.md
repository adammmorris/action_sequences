# Model-free RL or action sequences?

This repository contains the data and code for "Model-free RL or action sequences?", by Adam Morris & Fiery Cushman.

"expt1" and "expt2" contain the data and analysis code for Experiments 1 and 2, respectively.

"Simulations" contains all the simulation & model-fitting code. To recreate the simulation results, go to "Simulations/sims" and use the two R scripts. To recreate the fitting results, use "Simulations/getFitResults.m".
